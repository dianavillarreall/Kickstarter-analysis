# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
This analysis was created to observe the diverse outcomes of all the plays showed in the "Kickstarters" dataset according to their launch dates and funding goals to be utilized for the debut of the upcoming play Fever. By creating different tables and graphs according to their outcomes it will be easier to visualize the optimum decision to ensure the project’s success.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By dissecting the information to only visualize the number of plays by month and outcome with the total of project for each month it’s possible to create a graph that allows us to see the critical gap in the outcomes of each month to make an educated decision of the best time to debut a play.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To obtain the highest rate of success for a project depending on the funding goal it’s necessary to separate the goals by the amount of play that have failed, succeed and been canceled so we can get the percentage of each to make a graph that will facilitate us to see what would be the best decision.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When making the final decision of what would be the approximate optimum funding goal for the play it can be challenging due to some percentage being too strong but, it’s also important to pay attention to the total projects of each goal and not only the percentages since a hundred percent of success for a funding goal with only one project is not the same as an over seventy percent in goal with over five hundred projects.
## Results

### Conclusions obtain based on Launch Date
After analyzing the outcome of different plays based on their launch date, we see that debuting a play during the summer and spring, more specifically from April to August, has a higher probability of the play becoming successful as seen in the visible bigger gap between successful and failed projects during those months with may being the best month to debut a play. Debuting a play during the winter or fall has a higher risk of failing which you can see in the small gap between the failure and successful line showed on the graph with December being the riskiest month due to its high failed and canceled projects.
### Conclusions obtain based on Goals
As seen in the graph showing the different outcomes according to the funding goal for plays, we can conclude that the optimal amount to invest will be less than $10,000, you can see the big gap of successful and failed projects in the graph meaning that the risk for investing this amount on a play it’s extremely low.
### Limitations of this dataset and recommendations
Although it’s imperative to look at the launch date and funding goals of projects that have been successful and the ones that have failed to make an educated decision, there are more factors that might affect said decision like where the play wants to be debuted since the goals stated here vary by currencies, the amount of donations that are expected for it and the date they are planning to end the project. It would be recommended to also analyze the popularity of plays depending on the country and the differences between goals in it’s country of origin.
